## View Random Chrome Bookmark

### Premise

I started bookmarking a *lot* of stuff when I started learning to program. Often I could benefit by revisiting things that I've read or learned in the past and want a little hit of something interesting. I run this script, and get a random nugget (or collection of nuggets) for my brain to chew on for a few minutes. 

### Usage

##### Prerequisites
Chrome browser, with some pages bookmarked
NodeJS & npm

##### Running

Assuming the file is executable (```chmod +x ./view_random_chrome_bookmark.js``` will take care of that), just run it from the root directory. ```./view_random_chrome_bookmark.js```. Simples.
